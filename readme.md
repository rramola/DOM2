# DOM Practice 2:

Another small practice to hold y'all over for now. Use the "Choose Elements destination" selector to choose which destination div your element will be added to (div-1, div-2, div-3, or div-4). Use "Choose an element" to decide which element/tag type the created element will be. Use "Text to be displayed" input to add the text to the element. Use "afterbegin or beforeend" selector to choose the placement of the element inside of said destination. Only hint, insertAdjacentHtml.

Extra layer, use the "Item key to be removed" selector and the "remove" button to be able to remove specific elements that you have added. Don't forget to populate the drop box!
